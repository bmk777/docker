What we did
	We succsessfully got our program to upload files to the cluster from our machine, however when its run inside of a container it doesnt work
		I think this has to do with how we cant read from our machine so ill read from a github
	We succsessfully containerized and verified our container with gcp from local and docker containerized
	We succsessfully got the invertedindex job to work on our cluster by using the UI from google.
	We succsessfully switched to a python application bc java wasnt working
	We succsessfully Got the docker file to compile properly

What we need to do
	Get the docker to recognize the file we upload
	
	Start a job from the java program to generate the indicies
		This is the next 20%
		We will be at 80%

When done
	K frequency list
	highest appearing words
